# Intro
This is meant to be an extremely simple web app for learning morse code. You get a single button, you tap it. 

Learn one or two new letters at a time, doing drills, only proceeding once you master it.


## This project is on hold.
It was working fine for desktop browsers, but I encountered issues with mobile browsers. 

For example when you tap the button twice it just zooms in, instead of registering the tap.
I don't have time to fix it right now.
